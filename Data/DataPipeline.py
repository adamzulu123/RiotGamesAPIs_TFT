    This function retrieves basic player data for each rank, including: puuid, tier, division, wins, and losses.
    Important note: according to Riot's API, a 'win' only refers to a 1st place finish, 
    while 'losses' include placements from 2nd to 8th.

    However, in practice, players can still gain LP by finishing in the top 4 (1stâ€“4th place). 
    To evaluate performance more accurately, we should make additional API calls to fetch the exact placement for each match.
    This will allow us to redefine what we consider a 'win' based on actual in-game results rather than Riot's strict definition.
